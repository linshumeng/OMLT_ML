# OMLT

## gbt

They just use the formulation to load model and test things like len

## io

They test keras_reader, onnx_parser and bounds

## nn

They compare the result from omlt(say IPOPT) and original package

# scikit-learn

They create an array with true result to fit and predict

# Future work

- Result comparison from omlt and original package
